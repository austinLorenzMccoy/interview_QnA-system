Data Analytics,How do you handle missing data in a dataset?,"Common approaches include: removing rows with missing values, imputing with mean/median/mode, using advanced imputation techniques like KNN or regression, or treating missing values as a separate category."
Data Science,What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Examples: Classification (supervised) vs. Clustering (unsupervised)."
Data Science,Explain overfitting and how to prevent it.,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well, including noise. Prevention methods include cross-validation, regularization, increasing training data, and reducing model complexity."
Data Science,What is feature engineering and why is it important?,Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. It's crucial because good features can capture important patterns and relationships in the data.
Data Science,Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.,"Bias is error from oversimplified assumptions. Variance is error from sensitivity to training data variations. High bias leads to underfitting, high variance leads to overfitting. The goal is to find the optimal balance."
Data Science,What is the difference between correlation and causation?,"Correlation indicates a statistical relationship between variables, while causation implies that one variable directly causes changes in another. Correlation does not always imply causation."
AWS Cloud Computing,What is Amazon EC2 and what are its key features?,"EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual servers. Key features include instance types for different workloads, auto-scaling, load balancing, and pay-as-you-go pricing."

AWS Cloud Computing,What is AWS CloudFormation and its benefits?,"CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code service that lets you model AWS resources using templates. Benefits include version control, automated deployment, and consistent infrastructure."
Salesforce Administrator,What is the difference between Profile and Permission Sets?,"Profiles define base-level access and are required for users, while Permission Sets provide additional permissions that can be assigned flexibly without changing profiles."
Salesforce Administrator,Explain the different types of relationships in Salesforce.,Lookup relationships connect objects with optional association. Master-detail relationships create tight coupling where child records depend on parent. Many-to-many relationships use junction objects.
Salesforce Administrator,What are validation rules and when should you use them?,"Validation rules verify data meets specific criteria before saving. Use them to ensure data quality, enforce business rules, and prevent invalid data entry."
Salesforce Administrator,How do you manage duplicate records in Salesforce?,"Use Duplicate Rules to identify potential duplicates, Matching Rules to define matching criteria, and Duplicate Management tools to merge or handle duplicate records."
Salesforce Administrator,What is the difference between Workflow Rules and Process Builder?,"Workflow Rules handle simple automation with immediate actions. Process Builder offers more complex automation with multiple criteria and actions, including cross-object updates."
Front-End Development,What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?,"== performs type coercion before comparison, while === compares both value and type without coercion. === is generally preferred for strict equality comparison."
Front-End Development,Explain the box model in CSS.,"The box model consists of content, padding, border, and margin. Content is the actual element, padding is space around content, border surrounds padding, and margin is space outside border."
Front-End Development,What are React hooks and why were they introduced?,Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. They were introduced to avoid class components and share stateful logic between components.
Front-End Development,What is the Virtual DOM and how does it work?,Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to minimize direct DOM manipulation by comparing virtual DOMs and updating only changed elements.
Front-End Development,Explain CSS specificity and how it works.,Specificity determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. It's calculated based on selectors: inline styles > IDs > classes/attributes > elements.
Back-End Development,What is REST and what are its key principles?,"REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for APIs. Key principles include statelessness, client-server separation, uniform interface, and resource-based URLs."
Back-End Development,Explain database normalization and its forms.,"Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and dependency. Forms include 1NF (atomic values), 2NF (partial dependencies), 3NF (transitive dependencies), and BCNF."
Back-End Development,What are microservices and their advantages?,"Microservices are small, independent services that work together. Advantages include scalability, technology flexibility, easier maintenance, and faster deployment."
Back-End Development,How do you handle database transactions?,"Transactions ensure data integrity through ACID properties: Atomicity (all or nothing), Consistency (valid states), Isolation (concurrent operations), and Durability (permanent changes)."
Back-End Development,What is caching and when should you use it?,"Caching stores frequently accessed data in faster storage. Use it to improve performance, reduce database load, and handle high traffic by serving cached responses."
Virtual Assistant,What tools do you use for task management?,"Tools like Trello, Asana, or Monday.com for project tracking, Google Calendar for scheduling, and time-tracking software to monitor productivity and billable hours."
Virtual Assistant,How do you handle confidential information?,"Use secure password managers, encrypted communication, sign NDAs, follow data protection protocols, and maintain strict privacy standards for client information."

DevOps,Explain containerization and its advantages.,"Containerization packages applications with dependencies. Advantages include consistency across environments, isolation, scalability, and easier deployment."
DevOps,What is Infrastructure as Code?,"IaC manages infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. It enables version control, automated deployment, and consistent environments."
DevOps,How do you monitor application performance?,"Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic to monitor metrics, set alerts, track errors, and analyze performance patterns."
DevOps,What is Git branching strategy?,"Strategies like GitFlow organize development with main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches to manage code changes and releases effectively."
Cybersecurity,What is the CIA triad and why is it important?,"CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) are core principles of security. They ensure data is protected, accurate, and accessible to authorized users."

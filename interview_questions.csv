What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label."
Explain the difference between bagging and boosting.,"Bagging is a method that combines multiple models by training them on random subsets of the data with replacement. Boosting, however, trains models sequentially, each model trying to correct the errors of the previous one."
What is the p-value in hypothesis testing?,The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. It's used in hypothesis testing to determine significance.

How does Python handle memory management?,"Python uses a garbage collector and reference counting for memory management, automatically freeing up memory that is no longer needed by the program."
What are common techniques for handling missing data?,"Common techniques include deletion (dropping missing data), imputation (filling missing values with statistical methods), and predictive modeling to estimate the missing values."
What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label."

"What are RESTful APIs, and why are they important?","RESTful APIs adhere to REST architectural constraints and allow different applications to communicate over HTTP. They are important because they enable interoperability between different systems, making integrations easier."
"How do load balancers work, and why are they important?","Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, enhancing application availability and reliability. They are crucial for handling high traffic and ensuring system resilience."
"What is cross-site scripting (XSS), and how can it be prevented?","Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by others. It can be prevented by properly validating and escaping user input, and setting Content Security Policies (CSPs)."
